<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2.5 lb / 1.25 kg beef chuck , boneless short rib or any other slow cooking beef (no bone)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp each salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>2 onions , chopped (brown, white or yellow)</li>
        <li>6 oz / 180g bacon , speck or pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour (all purpose/plain, Note 3 for GF)</li>
        <li>440ml / 14.9 oz Guinness Beer (Note 1)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 cups (750 ml) chicken stock/broth (or beef broth – Note 4)</li>
        <li>3 carrots , peeled and cut into 1.25 cm / 1/2″ thick pieces</li>
        <li>2 large celery stalks , cut into 2cm / 1″ pieces</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme (or sub with 1 tsp dried thyme leaves)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into 5cm/2″ chunks. Pat dry then sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy based pot over high heat. Add beef in batches and brown well all over. Remove onto plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium. If the pot is looking dry, add oil.</li>
        <li>Cook garlic and onion for 3 minutes until softening, then add bacon.</li>
        <li>Cook until bacon is browned, then stir through carrot and celery.</li>
        <li>Add flour, and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.</li>
        <li>Add Guinness, chicken broth/stock and tomato paste. Mix well (to ensure flour dissolves well), add bay leaves and thyme.</li>
        <li>Return beef into the pot (including any juices). Liquid level should just cover – see video or photos.</li>
        <li>Cover, lower heat so it is bubbling gently. Cook for 2 hours – the beef should be pretty tender by now. Remove lid then simmer for a further 30 – 45 minutes or until the beef falls apart at a touch, the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>Skim off fat on surface, if desired. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove bay leaves and thyme.</li>
        <li>Serve with creamy mashed potatoes!!</li>
    </ol>
